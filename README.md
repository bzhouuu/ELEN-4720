# Course homeworks for ML at Columbia
This ia a ML course (Machine Learning for Singals, Information and Data) taught by Professor John Paisley at Columbia University. What this repository contains are ML algorithms coded from scratch using numpy in Python, as part of the course assessments. Below are the details:

`Supervised:`
1. Ridge regression (and p-th order)[HW1]
2. Bayes classifier and KNN [HW2]
3. Gaussian process [HW2]

Unsupervised:
1. K-means [HW3]
2. GMM and naive bayes [HW3]a
3. Matrix factorization [HW3]
4. Markov chains [HW4]
5. Nonnegative matrix factorization [HW4]
